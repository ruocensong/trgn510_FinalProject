## Overview of project
**1. Overview**
* One of the reasons why brain cancer is so terrible is that it is difficult for doctors to remove all the cancer cells clinically, and surviving cancer could turn normal brain cells into cancer cells again.
* In this project, I focus on patients with brain cancer by vital status, gender, race and age.

**2. Objectives**
* I analyze different gene expressions in different samples using Bioconductor.

## Data
I download the data from https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/. 201 cases are about white males and 128 cases are about white females dead of brain cancer from 10 to 60 years old.
